# housing-price-prediction
In this project I worked with a housing dataset to predict apartment prices in Tashkent.
**Data Cleaning:**
Handled missing values
Removed duplicates
Fixed inconsistent values

**Exploratory Data Analysis:**
Checked distributions
Found correlations between features and price

**Visualization**
Heatmaps for correlations
Scatterplots ,barplot,histplot,countplot

**Feature Engineering**
rooms_per_size = rooms / size
floor_ratio = level / max_levels
District encoded with mean price

**Machine Learning**
Linear Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
XGBoost
pipelines
**Result**
Best model - XGBoost
r2_score: 0.72,rmse_scores:0.29
