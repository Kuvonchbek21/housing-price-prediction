# housing-price-prediction
In this project I worked with a housing dataset to predict apartment prices in Tashkent.

**Data Cleaning:**
-Handled missing values,
-Removed duplicates,
-Fixed inconsistent values,

---

**Exploratory Data Analysis:**
-Checked distributions,
-Found correlations between features and price

---

**Visualization**
-heatmaps for correlations
-scatterplots , barplot, histplot, countplot

---

**Feature Engineering**
-rooms_per_size = rooms / size,
-floor_ratio = level / max_levels,
-District encoded with mean price,

---

**Machine Learning**
-Linear Regression,
-Decision Tree,
-Random Forest,
-XGBoost,
-Pipelines,

---

**Result**

-Best model - XGBoost,
-​R² Score: 72% — Our model explains 72% of the variance in house prices. This indicates a high level of accuracy.
-​RMSE Score: 29 — The average prediction error of our model is 29 units, showing that its predictions are very close to the actual prices.
-​Key Findings
​-The model's predictions are primarily based on the house size and the number of rooms.
​-Other variables like district and floor level had a negligible impact on the price within this dataset.
​-Recommendations for Improvement
​To further increase the model's accuracy beyond 90%, we recommend adding more features to the dataset, such as:
​The condition and year of construction.
​The distance from the city center.
​The availability of local infrastructure (schools, parks, stores, etc.).
